## Skill Set
> Programming and much more.

### 1. Programming

_Sorted by skill level from high to low._

  * Python
  * Java
  * C (including experience with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc))

### 2. GNU/Linux OS

Experiences with a range of Linux distributions (Ubuntu, former CentOS, Arch
Linux, Manjaro Linux, etc.) as server and/or desktop OS.

### 3. Photography

I love travelling with my camera. Recording my life with images help me
communicate with people, especially when we just met. A record of shared memory 
is also a good way to help bonding a group of people together.

This, I believe, have inspired me to apply what I have learnt from school and
college to real life problems including basic computational photography and 
constructing expandable and maintainable software to assist such processes.
