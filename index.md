## Education
September 2020 ~ June 2023: BSc Computer Science, UCL 

## Skill Set
> Programming and much more.

### 1. Programming

_Sorted by skill level from high to low._

  * Python  
  * Java  
  * C (including experience with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc))  

### 2. GNU/Linux OS

Experiences with a range of Linux distributions (Ubuntu, former CentOS, Arch
Linux, Manjaro Linux, etc.) as server and/or desktop OS.

### 3. Photography

I love travelling with my camera. Recording my life with images help me
communicate with people, especially when we just met. A record of shared memory 
is also a good way to help bonding a group of people together.

This, I believe, have inspired me to apply what I have learnt from school and
college to real life problems including basic computational photography and 
constructing expandable and maintainable software to assist such processes.

## Topic of Interests

### 1. Computer Vision (CV)

As a photography enthusiast, the interest on computer vision grew naturally on
me. It has been mind blowing to me to see PhotoShop Lightroom to be able to
automatically categorize photos of different people using face recognition.
Further more, during the Covid-19 period, many of the examinations that I took
part in involved scanning hand written answers on paper into a digital copy
(PDF) and submitting them electronically, at which I started to appreciate the
power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). At the moment, I am working with
[Sky](https://sky.com) and some peers in UCL to build a tool to help detecting
and generating penalty kick clips from football matches. This has been an
inspiring topic so far, which really helped me to develop my understanding about
CV in general. I would love to understand more under this topic, which is not 
only a rewarding process in terms of my computer science carrer but may also be 
a handy tool for my photography workflow.

### 2. Operating System

Having been a Linux user for many years, I have had some experience with
repairing some random or artificial bugs occurred in the system. However,
limited by the scale of my server and my use cases, my understanding to the OS 
itself is still quite limited. Thus, although I have not taken any OS-related
courses at my college, I would love to have a chance to study from the 
top-of-the-class system engineers and OS maintainer about how a large scale,
production-ready operating system is deployed and maintained.
system is maintained.

### 3. Software Engineering

Having witnessed the growth of Windows OS, Android OS on mobiles and a number of
other large-scale software projects, it has been a mysterious topic to me how
the development team organised the workload to make it maintainable and
scalable, as well as excellent back-ward compatibility. Therefore, it would be a
pleasure for me if I get to work with such people on a piece of real-life, 
large-scale program so that I can have some understanding about how they are
constructed from scratch.
